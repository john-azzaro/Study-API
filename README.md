## What is API Study?
API study is an examination of how to retrieve and display data from web API's using either AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScritp and XML) or getJson (i.e. a short-cut version of AJAX but does not give you as much control as AJAX method).  

<br>

## Does the API Study feature commentary?
Yes!  API study features step-by-step commentary.  In this particualr study, there are two JavaScript files for reference.  The first, index.js, is clear so you can see the code without interruption.  The second, index2.js, features the exact same code as index.js but the commentary is laid out progressively so you can follow along with the logic.
